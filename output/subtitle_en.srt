1
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,667
Tschick!

2
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,125
(Goodbye Berlin)

3
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,584
Actually, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for Tatjana.

4
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,626
Even though she had nothing to
with the whole thing.

5
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,584
Is what I'm talking about hard to follow?

6
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,584
Yeah, well, sorry.

7
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:47,042
Tatjana Cosic isn't even part of the story.

8
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,292
The prettiest girl in the world plays no part.

9
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,792
-My vacation. -Now...

10
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:56,292
For summer last year we went to the sea.

11
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,209
We were stuck in our rubber dingy.

12
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,626
The paddles were in the water.

13
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:04,834
It got pretty hot in the sun.

14
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:09,042
Luckily the coast guard got us out.

15
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,001
Maik!

16
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:14,042
They rescued us. Thank God.

17
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,792
Put in some effort next time, Justin.

18
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,375
Sit down.

19
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,918
Who's next?

20
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,042
"It's my birthday in three weeks."

21
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,292
"First Saturday of summer. Party!"

22
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,334
"There'll be an invite. Love, Tatjana."

23
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:35,918
Vacation. Water. Rescue. God.

24
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,083
Maik Klingenberg.

25
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,125
Please come up.

26
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,042
Maik, sometime today.

27
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,751
My mother and the beauty farm.
By Maik Klingenberg.

28
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,876
I like my mother. She's not like other mothers.

29
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,959
She can be very funny.

30
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,375
Most moms aren't.

31
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,209
My mother plays tennis.

32
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,209
She's the family tennis nut.

33
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,751
She won the club
championship
even with a bottle of vodka in her system.

34
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:15,083
Need help, mom?

35
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,417
It's all right.

36
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:34,042
This conversation often comes up:

37
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:35,709
Mrs. Weber asks my mother:

38
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,792
Are you in the summer match, Mrs. Klingenberg?

39
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,751
Don't worry. I'll be gone.

40
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:42,250
Where to?

41
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:44,751
The beauty farm.

42
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,918
Then somebody at the table
who didn't know the phrase

43
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,876
always threw out the clever quip:

44
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,626
You don't need help with that, Mrs. Klingenberg.

45
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,209
That's a joke. It's a rehab facility.

46
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,959
We'd walk home hand in hand

47
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,167
since she was no longer capable of driving.

48
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,417
I carried her heavy racket bag
and she said to me,

49
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,792
"You can't learn much from me.
But two things you can learn:"

50
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:16,959
"First, you can talk about anything."

51
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,417
"Second, what others think doesn't mean shit."

52
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:20,584
Psycho!

53
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,209
Quiet, please.

54
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,209
Thanks, Maik.

55
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,209
I'm not finished.

56
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:29,042
How much longer is it?

57
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,000
Six pages.

58
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,959
That'll do for today.

59
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,501
Was that funny to you?

60
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,001
Maik?

61
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,626
It's your mother.

62
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,250
Did you think about that?

63
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,375
Your mother.

64
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,001
Do you get that?

65
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:56,167
I get that my mother is my mother.

66
00:05:57,042 --> 00:06:00,959
Your story was the most sickening,
unsavory, and shameless.

67
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,834
I've encountered in 30 years of teaching.

68
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,584
You should rip these pages out.

69
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:14,042
I don't mean literally,
I mean think about what you've done

70
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:15,959
Really think!

71
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:20,709
Quite clearly, I'd made a big mistake.

72
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,083
But I didn't know what I'd done wrong.

73
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:27,667
Wagenbach didn't tell me,
and I still don't know.

74
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,792
He told me to think.

75
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,542
But all I could think about
was Tatjana's birthday.

76
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,375
It was all anybody talked about.

77
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,959
I heard Tatjana's uncle is bringing
his own beer tap with 100 liters.

78
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,459
Wow! I already ordered condoms on Amazon.

79
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,876
Word was that everyone would be invited.

80
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,125
I tried desperately
to think of a present for her.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,667
(A HAPPY NEW HOME)

82
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,209
It had to be something special.
But I couldn't come up with anything

83
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,459
And then I hit on an idea.

84
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:18,792
... the bankruptcy guy?
That jerk can kiss my ass.

85
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,001
Hey, Maik, there's a front door too.

86
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,459
Do you know what I'm going to do
to those eco-fascists?

87
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:48,292
I guess I wanted her to see
I put a lot of effort into it.

88
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,501
If you put in a lot of effort, people guess why.

89
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,000
Good morning.

90
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:01,417
Come up front with me.

91
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,334
So...

92
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:07,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please,

93
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,250
we've got a new classmate.

94
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,542
His name is Andrej.

95
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:15,375
Tsch... Tschicha...tschoroff.

96
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,709
Tschichatschow.

97
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,751
Please?

98
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,626
Tschichatschow.

99
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,001
Would you like to tell us about yourself,
where you're from?

100
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,584
I don't care.

101
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:30,167
Okay, fine, I will then.

102
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,292
Or would you rather I not?

103
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,667
Go ahead.

104
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,751
So, Andrej...

105
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,667
Tschi-chow is our new classmate's name,

106
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,083
and he's from the vast expanses of Russia.

107
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:46,001
Right away I couldn't stand Tschick.

108
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,209
No one could.

109
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,250
Tschick was trash, and he looked the part.

110
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:56,918
I had a rotten feeling about him
up there with Wagenbach:

111
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,292
two assholes for the price of one.

112
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,834
...
now he's here at our high school.

113
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:03,417
And all that in just four years.

114
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,501
Isn't that something? Was that right?

115
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,584
About 90% of it.

116
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,626
Well then, fine.

117
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:13,083
We can't have you up here all day,
as nice as it is chatting with you.

118
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,709
Please take the open desk

119
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,667
in the second row next to Maik Klingenberg.

120
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:21,626
Laila, could you please wipe the blackboard?

121
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,876
And so, everyone take out their notebooks...

122
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,959
A scent wafted over that almost knocked me over.

123
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,751
... about Napoleon Bonaparte, before...

124
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,709
It was the smell of my mother on a bad day.

125
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:43,167
Something just had to happ
after his performance with Wagenbach.

126
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
It was sure to be interesting.

127
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,125
But then nothing happened in the next few days.

128
00:09:50,334 --> 00:09:53,375
Then a week later, we got our math test back.

129
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,834
Here Kevin, a D-.

130
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,542
I put mercy above justice.

131
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,083
A miracle happened!

132
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,000
One of you got an A+.

133
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:03,959
(15.5 of 20 points, grade 2)

134
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,083
Not you.

135
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,167
Fuck...

136
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,292
You either.

137
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,250
Andrej,

138
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,459
Congratulations.

139
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,459
(19 of 20 points, grade 1)

140
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:16,959
Go to the board and show us
how you solved problem 2.

141
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:39,542
New shoes? Stolen for sure!

142
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,584
-Tschick! -Hey, Putin!

143
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:42,792
Drunk as a skunk?

144
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,250
What do you want?

145
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,501
That fired up the rumor machine:

146
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,918
like that Tschick's family was Russian mafia.

147
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:07,834
There was no other explanation for how

148
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,876
he shut that fool down with just few words.

149
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,000
This came for you today!

150
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:41,584
Thanks!

151
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,375
Then, on the last day of school...

152
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,834
-Nadine... -For justin.

153
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,167
I'd have been the happiest guy in the universe

154
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,501
if finally an invite found its way to me...

155
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:12,834
Hey, Maik.

156
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,334
Laura Krämer...

157
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,209
Hey Psycho.

158
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,751
Give it here. It's for me.

159
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,042
Maik Klingenberg.

160
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,375
Here you go.

161
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,250
Everyone had a little green invite.

162
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:42,834
Natalie.

163
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:45,959
Almost everyone.

164
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,125
Tschick didn't get one either.

165
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,125
Big surprise.

166
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,501
No invite for the psycho or the weirdo.

167
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,083
Maik!

168
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,709
I completely forgot you!

169
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,459
Here's your invite. I hope you can make it.

170
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:06,250
I'd be so disappointed if you, of all people,
couldn't make it.

171
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,417
I hope you thought of my present.

172
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,751
Of course, I can depend on you!

173
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:13,042
See you there.

174
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,792
I'm so happy you're coming!

175
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,250
Have a nice summer, Klingenberg.

176
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,292
Ultra kick-ass jacket.

177
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,083
-What? -Your jacket.

178
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,667
I'll buy it.

179
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,542
It's my favorite. Not for sale.

180
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,083
Where can I get one?

181
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,501
Hey, wait up! Where are you going?

182
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,626
Did you get held back?

183
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,167
Why are you shouting?

184
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,209
-Did you fail? -no.

185
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,959
-Bunch of ds, eh? -No idea.

186
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,501
No idea? If I'm bugging you, say the word.

187
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,584
I don't know.

188
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,417
You don't know if I bug you?
-I don't know if I got Ds.

189
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,584
I didn't look yet.

190
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:10,542
You didn't check your report card?

191
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:12,584
Way to play it cool!

192
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,042
-What are you up to now? -Going home.

193
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:17,167
-And then? -None of your damn business.

194
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,959
Hey Maik,

195
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,667
ultra kick-ass jacket!

196
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,834
Mom?

197
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,125
Mom?

198
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:10,751
I'm going back to the beauty farm tomorrow.

199
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,501
Maik?

200
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:01,959
Turn down the music.

201
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,834
I have a business meeting.

202
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,375
I'm being picked up soon.

203
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:10,709
How long?

204
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,667
14 days or so. Is that all right?

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,334
I'll leave you 200 euros.

206
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:26,876
So you don't get into trouble.

207
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,751
Why do you hang in here?

208
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,876
We have a pool.

209
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,334
How much do you think it cost me?

210
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:50,709
Hi.

211
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:52,542
Hello.

212
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,959
I'm Mona. What's your name?

213
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,000
Maik.

214
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,292
It's hot, huh?

215
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,751
It's supposed to get hotter.

216
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,834
What are you doing for summer?

217
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,209
I'm staying here.

218
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,709
By yourself?

219
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't feel sorry for this guy.

220
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,125
Maik, this is Mona. We work together.

221
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,834
We just met.

222
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,375
If there's anything, call me.

223
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,626
During your business meeting?

224
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,709
Yes, during my business meeting.

225
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:09,834
Not on our property, bitch.

226
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't get into trouble!

227
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:40,001
You look like a homo
whose garden got shat all over.

228
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:55,792
Did you steal that car?

229
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:58,083
No, just borrowed it.

230
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,667
I'll put it back later.

231
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,334
Lada Niva, runs on diesel.

232
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,250
-What about finger prints? -That's TV bullshit.

233
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,834
Go ahead, touch anything.

234
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,542
-You want to go to jail? -I'm only 14, man.

235
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,375
Criminal accountability starts at 15.

236
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,042
Come on, Maik, let's go for a spin.

237
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,250
No!

238
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:48,542
-Kick-ass pool. -Yeah, kick-ass pool.

239
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,417
Kick-ass jacket, kick-ass pool.

240
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:56,918
That's your kitchen?

241
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,125
Kick-ass kitchen!

242
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:07,250
You're not from Marzahn.

243
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,751
My father dragged us here two years ago.

244
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,250
-What's he do? -Real estate developer.

245
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,375
Developers make that much money

246
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,375
Not really.

247
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,042
What do you mean?

248
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,876
My dad wanted to build houses here.

249
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:28,292
But they found
three extinct bugs and a rare frog.

250
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:31,083
So, no permit. He only built this house.

251
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,667
It now belongs to the bank.

252
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,417
What's the frog called?

253
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,167
Anura rossomontana.

254
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,375
Okay...

255
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,001
Man! I can't see you!

256
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:55,792
Are you in a tank?

257
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,834
I'm behind the barn.

258
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,417
In a pinch, go to the last safe spot.

259
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,000
You going to the party?

260
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,792
What party?

261
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,876
Tatjana's party.

262
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:13,792
Nah, don't feel like it.

263
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,292
Seriously?

264
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,250
I've got plans.

265
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,459
Besides, I'm not invited.

266
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,584
Whoa.

267
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,292
I thought I was the only one.

268
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,375
It'll be boring anyway.

269
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,292
Simla will be there.

270
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:34,001
And Natalie,

271
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,417
Laura, Corinna,

272
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,250
and Sarah with the big tits.

273
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,501
Not to mention Tatjana.

274
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,918
And Mia.

275
00:22:43,918 --> 00:22:46,334
And sweet-ass Jennifer from class 8a.

276
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,083
And her cousin.

277
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:50,000
And Melanie.

278
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,959
Melanie...

279
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,000
Are you gay, actually?

280
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Are you nuts?

281
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,083
Because you don't care about girls.

282
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,459
Ha?

283
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,626
The whole class is hot for Tatjana.

284
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,417
You're the only one not staring at her ass,

285
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:13,042
so are you gay?

286
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:14,751
You're an idiot.

287
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:15,918
It's no big deal.

288
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:19,125
Did you notice I'm in a bad mood?

289
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,584
Sure, but why?

290
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:22,042
Because it's today.

291
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,083
-What's today? -The party, duh.

292
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,501
Tatjana's party!

293
00:23:25,501 --> 00:23:27,459
A minute ago you didn't feel like it.

294
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:28,667
It's okay to be gay.

295
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,459
I'm not gay!

296
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:31,959
Want me to prove it?

297
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,417
You have feelings for her.

298
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,792
You gotta do something!

299
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,083
Do what? Go to Tatjana and say,

300
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,000
"I have a little gift."

301
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,501
"I don't mind at all you didn't invite me."

302
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,334
"No problem. I was just passing by."

303
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,501
"Enjoy the drawing that
I just worked my ass off on."

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,959
That's exactly what I would do.

305
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,918
You didn't signal.

306
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:11,417
Don't be afraid.

307
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,959
-I drive like a champ.
-Then signal like a champ

308
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:15,918
Everyone sees where I'm going.

309
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,959
We're not going to the party,
just driving by, okay?

310
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,709
Know why Tatjana didn't invite you?

311
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:24,876
Because I'm boring and ugly.

312
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,292
There's no reason to.

313
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:30,167
You don't stand out. You gotta get noticed.

314
00:24:50,876 --> 00:24:53,459
Look, it's Lukas and Justin, retards.

315
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,626
We don't go in. We said just drive by.

316
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,876
Okay.

317
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:06,709
Tschick!

318
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,542
Tschick!

319
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,125
Please don't, Tschick!

320
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:16,459
Tschick, please don't.

321
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:17,792
It'll be fine.

322
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:19,876
Wait up!

323
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,667
Here.

324
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:06,918
A drawing.

325
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,042
For you.

326
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,626
Hey Tatjana!

327
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,501
Want a drink?

328
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:36,542
No thanks, we've got stuff to do.

329
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,459
Should I give them a show?

330
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,584
-Should I? -Do whatever you want.

331
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,000
Floor it!

332
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,250
That doesn't work every time.

333
00:27:26,834 --> 00:27:28,459
See you tomorrow?

334
00:27:29,001 --> 00:27:30,542
Okay, I'll be here at 10.

335
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,042
Kick-ass ride.

336
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,667
What if we just kept driving?

337
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:47,292
Where to?

338
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,667
I have a grandfather in Wallachia.

339
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,459
The middle of nowhere?

340
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:56,375
Not the middle of nowhere, in Wallachia.

341
00:27:56,834 --> 00:28:00,250
Wallachia is just a word, like East Bumfuck.

342
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,001
Saying someone lives in Wallachia means
they live in the boondocks.

343
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:06,459
It isn't a place?

344
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,292
-Nope. -But my grandpa lives there.

345
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,667
-In the boondocks, really?
-You're getting on my nerves.

346
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,918
He lives in a place called Wallachia.

347
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,501
That's where we're going.

348
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:33,834
So, are you Russian? Or Wallachian

349
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,542
German. I have a passport.

350
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,834
Yeah, but where are you from?

351
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:39,417
My family is from all over.

352
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,584
Volga Germans, Kalmyks, Wallachians,

353
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,125
Jewish Gypsies.

354
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,125
Jewish Gypsies, there's no such thing.

355
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,167
That's like saying there are English French.

356
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:53,375
There are Jewish French and Jewish Gypsies.

357
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,501
Either you're a Jew or a Gypsy.

358
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,959
Jewish is a religion.
A Gypsy is just someone without a home.

359
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:01,375
People without homes are Berbers.

360
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,459
Yeah right, Berbers are carpets.

361
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,375
Lemme see!

362
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,459
Hey, that was expensive!

363
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,626
Any cocksucker can find us with that.

364
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:24,292
Hey!

365
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,001
Want to get scraped off the side of the road?

366
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,501
Sense-less!

367
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:43,334
Don't we have a map? No phone, no map!

368
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:44,834
We'll never get there.

369
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,459
Maps are for pussies.

370
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:48,209
We just have to drive south.

371
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,459
Look at this guy.

372
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:57,959
Richard Claydé-erman.

373
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:15,959
Totally awesome.

374
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,709
You sure you're not gay?

375
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,626
Don't take the autobahn!

376
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:28,417
-I'm not. -Yes you are!

377
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,918
I'm going south.

378
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:31,876
Shit!

379
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,876
I couldn't see 'cause of the fog.

380
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,542
You assholes! What the fuck?

381
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:53,501
Say it, how old are you? You chicken!

382
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,375
He'll see you're only 14.

383
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:58,292
I call police!

384
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,667
He's calling the police! Tschick, exit!

385
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:03,250
I forgot to turn on the lights.

386
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:33,209
Kevin Kurányi!

387
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,375
You don't look like Kevin Kurányi!

388
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:38,959
You look like a 14-year-old
with duct tape on your silly mug.

389
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:47,792
That's it.

390
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,751
It's perfect for around here.

391
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,584
Which way is south?

392
00:32:05,959 --> 00:32:10,667
You do know that with a watch
you can tell the direction?

393
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:16,042
Here, aim one hand at the sun

394
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:18,334
and the other points north.

395
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:22,292
Then that's north.

396
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,125
-Since when is the sun in the north?
-Right now.

397
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,042
Now look,

398
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:30,792
the sun rises in the east,
moves south and sets in the west.

399
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,918
It's never in the north.

400
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,083
Then it's daylight savings.

401
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,876
It doesn't work in summer. Turn it back an hour.

402
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,626
But the directions don't spin around.

403
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,083
Maybe it's a gyrocompass.

404
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,501
A gyrocompass doesn't spin like a gyroscope.

405
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,292
It spins with alcohol.

406
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,292
You're shitting me.

407
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:49,584
I read it in a book.

408
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:52,876
A sailor breaks open the compass
'cause he's an alcoholic,

409
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:55,834
and then they all get lost.

410
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,083
The book was "The Sea Bear" or "The Sea Wolf"...

411
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,542
You mean "Steppenwolf" that's about drugs.

412
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,834
Steppenwolf is a band.

413
00:33:03,834 --> 00:33:05,250
Sense-less!

414
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,501
I'm going right.

415
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,000
I think Clayderman is dying!

416
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:00,000
This is good.

417
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,250
It's a dead end.

418
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,001
I'm not driving back now!

419
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:12,000
Tschick, what are you doing?

420
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,709
Tschick!

421
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,250
Drive your name!

422
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,709
My name?

423
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:36,167
So we can read it on Google Earth!

424
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,584
Now snake around for the S.

425
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:14,167
This kicks ass!

426
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:44,876
You losers, get out of the way!

427
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:52,083
Farmer at 6 o'clock!

428
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,584
No, the farmer!

429
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,334
-Shit! -Hurry, drive!

430
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,459
-Hurry up! -The cows are in the way!

431
00:35:58,459 --> 00:36:00,792
Just run them down! Hurry!

432
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,000
Drive from field! Stupid ass!

433
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,334
-Drive, go! -I can't!

434
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:08,083
"I can't drive faster..." "Go, forward, Tschick!"

435
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,334
Tschick go!

436
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,584
-Go! -I'm trying!

437
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:16,709
Put the pedal to the metal, dude!

438
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:17,709
Drive!

439
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,501
Loose him! Drive! Drive!

440
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,667
Go, Tschick!

441
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:25,417
-Lost him! Yeah! -Gimme five!

442
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:26,876
Boss!

443
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:28,209
-Yes -Hahahaa

444
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,334
We showed them!

445
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,167
Where are you going?

446
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:21,584
We've got to get the Lada off the roads
for a couple of days.

447
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,375
Dude, Transformers!

448
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,626
Got a can opener?

449
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:46,083
You brought cans but no can opener?

450
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,501
What did you bring?

451
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:54,459
Frozen pizza. Bring an oven?

452
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:00,751
Got a lighter?

453
00:38:02,918 --> 00:38:04,000
Hold this.

454
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,042
Sense-less.

455
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:19,125
Goal for Mario Götze! It's all over now!

456
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,667
Want to have a go?

457
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,667
Wow.

458
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,918
That's crazy.

459
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:40,834
Way better than TV.

460
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,417
You seen "Starship Troopers"?

461
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,709
-With the monkeys? -No, bugs.

462
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:48,626
And the brain at the end?

463
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,042
-The giant brain bug? -Yeah!

464
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,667
Somewhere up there, on one of those stars,

465
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,417
that's what's happening.

466
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:02,751
Actual bugs are slaughtering millions.

467
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:05,584
Nobody even knows about it.

468
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,125
Except for us.

469
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,000
Really think something's out there?

470
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:16,042
The chances are very slim.

471
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:19,292
But since it's infinitely large,

472
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:23,083
there's a good chance
even for the slimmest odds...

473
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,292
And somewhere there's a movie

474
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,792
that plays on Earth

475
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,209
about two kids who steal a car.

476
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,375
They all think it's sci-fi:

477
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,834
People and cars.

478
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,292
Nobody believes it.

479
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,001
Except for two young bugs.

480
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,501
They believe it.

481
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,959
They just hot-wired a helicopter.

482
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:48,584
And they're thinking the same thing.

483
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,167
They believe in us

484
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,792
because we believe in them.

485
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,709
-Crazy. -Crazy.

486
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,459
Where's the orphanage you escaped from?

487
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:28,000
We didn't, we're Mobile Nobles,
traveling from manor to manor.

488
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,001
Are you cyclists too?

489
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,209
We're automobilists.

490
00:40:34,209 --> 00:40:36,709
You were wrong. They're automobilists.

491
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:40,292
Mobile Nobles, what's that?

492
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,876
Certainly not proletariats in chariots.

493
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,584
Gloria!

494
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,292
Karl-Theodore!

495
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,751
I think your baron is calling.

496
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:57,167
He's a count.

497
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,417
-Who are those guys? -Mobile nobles.

498
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,292
I am so excited.

499
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,542
Don't we have anything to eat?

500
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:20,667
-Let's ask them. We're not weirdos.

501
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,375
Where you going?

502
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,751
-To the lada? -I have to eat.

503
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,042
I thought we were hiding the Lada.

504
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,417
A guy's gotta eat, or he'll die.

505
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:47,083
-Norma! -Norma!

506
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:53,209
(Norma 1 kilometer Preußlitz)

507
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:58,667
Where's Norma?

508
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:02,167
Hey, I asked you a question.

509
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:06,167
-We don't go to the supermarket.
-But where is it?

510
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:10,000
-We buy food from family Fröhlich.
-Oh, the Fröhlichs.

511
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,918
But where is the supermarket?

512
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,792
The Fröhlichs live that way.

513
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,918
-Hello Friedemann! -Hello, Constable!

514
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:21,918
Let's try again.

515
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:23,792
Where is Norma?

516
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,125
Are you just going to have a look?

517
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:31,000
Do you go to a supermarket just to look?

518
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,667
We want to buy food!

519
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,417
Friedemann!

520
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,292
Come home, it's noon.

521
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,792
Do you know where Norma is?

522
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:42,709
They want to buy food, mommy!

523
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:45,501
-Norma who? -The supermarket!

524
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:48,626
Oh! We never go there. We go to the Fröhlichs.

525
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:52,083
-We heard. -What do you want there?

526
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,959
Grocery shopping. We're hungry.

527
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:58,125
We're about to have lunch. Join us.

528
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,167
-What's for lunch, my dear lady? -Risi Bisi.

529
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:21,792
So.

530
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,292
Wait!

531
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:33,000
We hold hands in prayer
and thank God for his care,

532
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,626
the beautiful Earth where everything grows...

533
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,001
We'll make it short.

534
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,209
May this meal be blessed.

535
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,834
Holy moly.

536
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:51,751
Delectable!

537
00:44:05,918 --> 00:44:08,001
Stop! First the questions!

538
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,542
Wait, I have to think of one.

539
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:12,959
Ah, yes.

540
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What did Merope Gaunt get
for Slytherin's locket...

541
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,001
12 galleons!

542
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:21,167
10 galleons!

543
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,584
Elizabeth was the fastest.

544
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,501
What was the name of the ship

545
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,292
that Alexander von Humboldt...

546
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,584
Pizarro!

547
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,834
Good job, Friedemann.

548
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,459
Why did I say 12?

549
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:44,626
How about a guest round?

550
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:46,000
That's not fair!

551
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,375
After that it's your turn.

552
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:54,501
Who was the first president of Germany?

553
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:55,584
Adenauer?

554
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,209
Helmut Kohl!

555
00:44:57,209 --> 00:44:59,125
Heuss, Lübke, Heinemann, Scheel, Carstens,

556
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:02,000
Weizsäcker, Herzog, Köhler, Wulff, Gauck.

557
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,459
Good Jonas.

558
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:06,334
Now you can ask a question.

559
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:09,334
What's the capital of Germany?

560
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,709
I'd say Berlin.

561
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:13,584
Me too.

562
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,042
Then, dig in.

563
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:38,375
Here's a melon.
It's good for when you get thirsty too.

564
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,083
-Thank you. -Thanks a lot.

565
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:43,542
-Bye. -Bye!

566
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,083
Now I have a quiz question:

567
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:53,125
How do you figure out
where north is by using a watch?

568
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,459
Aim your hour hand at the sun,
then wind the minute hand to 12,

569
00:45:56,459 --> 00:45:58,001
then it points south.

570
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:00,125
Correct!

571
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:02,459
-Bye. -Bye.

572
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,125
Cool people.

573
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:08,501
So smart.

574
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:13,083
Where was the father?

575
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:15,250
Good question.

576
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,584
Go ahead. I gotta pee.

577
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:17,834
Okay.

578
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,751
"Show me your driver's license! " "was... wait!"

579
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:49,209
How old are you?

580
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:51,626
Open this door!

581
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:53,626
Open it now!

582
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,125
Darn you!

583
00:47:01,292 --> 00:47:03,667
Shit, Maik, sorry!

584
00:47:18,918 --> 00:47:20,501
Don't make it worse for yourself!

585
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,542
Stay right there!

586
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,209
What was I to do?

587
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:30,167
I was 100km, maybe 200km, south of Berlin.

588
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:34,834
Tschick just drove off in the light blue Lada
that every cop was now after.

589
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:38,042
I had no idea
how we would find each other again.

590
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:44,792
Normally, I guess you'd try to meet up

591
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:47,000
at the spot you'd lost each other.

592
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:49,125
But that wouldn't work now,

593
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,167
the village sheriff was waiting there.

594
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:01,125
Hello?

595
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:16,626
If you can't meet
where you'd last seen each other,

596
00:49:16,626 --> 00:49:19,125
you go back to the last safe spot
you'd been together.

597
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,042
The wind turbines!

598
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,959
The simplest solution!

599
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,083
The more I thought about it,

600
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:28,250
the more convinced I was
that Tschick would have the same idea.

601
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:39,001
Tschick?

602
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:42,209
Tschick!

603
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,667
Tschick.

604
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,501
-Last safe spot! -Last safe spot!

605
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:08,626
Man!

606
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,292
Man!

607
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,751
-How do you like the color? -Kick-ass!

608
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:27,667
-Where did you get the license plate? -Munich.

609
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:38,834
Shit, we're out of gas.

610
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,709
(Raststätte 1000 meter)

611
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,626
Where are we gonna get gas?

612
00:50:57,542 --> 00:50:59,792
What if we just steal another car?

613
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:01,667
Are you nuts?

614
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:04,375
We can't steal a new car
every time we run out of gas.

615
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:11,709
Then that's the end of our trip.

616
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:15,876
I wanted to take the Lada back.

617
00:51:21,334 --> 00:51:23,125
We're stupid!

618
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:26,375
We just have to get gas from another car.

619
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:31,542
How?

620
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:34,375
We need a hose.

621
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:00,959
Maik!

622
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:08,334
Great, what about a hose?

623
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,751
Not a trace.

624
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,000
Get out of here!

625
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:30,292
What?

626
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,125
You morons!

627
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,334
Are you crazy?

628
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:35,000
You heard me, moron.

629
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,417
Your friend is a moron too!

630
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,042
Who is that bitch?

631
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:41,001
You're too dumb to fuck!

632
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,209
Shove it up your ass and shut up!

633
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,876
-Fucking Oriental! -I'm Russian!

634
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:48,417
-Russian pansy! -I'm about to come up there!

635
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:51,542
Come on up, pussy! Oh, I'm so scared!

636
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:54,459
She's not right in the head.

637
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:57,918
What were you looking for?

638
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:59,501
A pile of shit!

639
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,542
We were looking for hoses.

640
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:07,167
Hoses are over there.

641
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,417
Hoses!

642
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,626
What do you need it for?

643
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:27,292
It's a birthday present for my father.

644
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:32,001
I showed you where the crap was,
now tell me why you want it.

645
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,501
We stole a car.

646
00:54:33,501 --> 00:54:35,584
Now we have to steal gas.

647
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:37,584
For sure, you retards!

648
00:54:37,584 --> 00:54:39,626
Even though I showed you them!

649
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:46,459
Go ahead, do want you want.

650
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,584
Yo, Maik.

651
00:54:52,542 --> 00:54:53,501
Perfect.

652
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:03,334
-Got anything to eat? -Do we look like we do?

653
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:05,667
You look like retards!

654
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:08,083
You're repeating yourself.

655
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,292
I'm hungry.

656
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,792
There's blackberries back there.

657
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:27,459
I thought you were queer.

658
00:55:27,459 --> 00:55:29,667
Because of the lipstick.

659
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,042
Where are you going?

660
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:36,375
Wallachia.

661
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,334
I'm going to Prague. It's on the way.

662
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:41,042
No it's not.

663
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:42,876
Hey!

664
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,542
Ever notice you stink?

665
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:50,209
You stink like a pile of shit. Piss off.

666
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:06,751
You didn't have to tell her she stinks.

667
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:09,459
I had to say something.

668
00:56:09,459 --> 00:56:12,167
And man, she did stink!

669
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:15,918
She had pretty eyes, but she was a weirdo.

670
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:29,334
-It's open! -Sweet!

671
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,584
First, suck it.

672
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:42,083
Ever heard of gravity? It won't flow up!

673
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:45,709
Once it's started, overall it flows downward.

674
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:47,918
But the gas doesn't know that!

675
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:50,167
It's a law of physics.

676
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:52,334
It's got a name, something force.

677
00:56:52,334 --> 00:56:54,167
The bullcrap force.

678
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:56,709
-You never saw it in a movie?
-Yeah, in a movie.

679
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:01,209
Maybe the tank's empty.

680
00:57:03,459 --> 00:57:05,417
It's wet. There's got to be gas.

681
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:08,501
Someone's coming.

682
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,626
Let's go.

683
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:19,876
-What are you doing? -Camouflage.

684
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,751
You morons!

685
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:33,167
Real pros!

686
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,209
Can you shout louder?

687
00:57:34,209 --> 00:57:35,417
Too dumb to fuck!

688
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:38,292
-Ever heard of sucking? We were sucking!

689
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:40,876
Give me the hose.

690
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,667
Didn't you ever steal gas in Russia?

691
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:56,751
No, I didn't, you racist.

692
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:58,250
Why didn't it work for us?

693
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:01,001
This has to be below the water level.

694
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,709
-Oh, below the water level. -Right.

695
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:07,876
-What water level? -Ask her.

696
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,834
My name's Isa.

697
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:14,459
Good for you.

698
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:15,626
Why are you going to Prague?

699
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,626
I have to visit my half-sister.

700
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:30,001
-Too warm? -No, you still stink.

701
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,375
There are things living in there.

702
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:38,918
I know.

703
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,001
Play this cassette.

704
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:05,083
Ever notice that a mirror switches
left and right, but not up and down?

705
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah, I have noticed that.

706
01:00:09,001 --> 01:00:10,501
Don't even think about it.

707
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:34,584
Check it out.

708
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:44,292
-She can't swim! -She's acting.

709
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:49,125
You retards!

710
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,042
Here's a present. Soap!

711
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,918
You've probably never seen that!

712
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:56,751
I do feel a bit sor...

713
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:05,626
You're dumber than your boyfriend.

714
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,375
A gentleman swims like this.

715
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:31,501
Give me soap too.

716
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:02,250
I'll get us some food.

717
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,417
I want you to cut my hair.

718
01:03:30,834 --> 01:03:32,751
I've never cut hair before.

719
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:34,751
I don't care. I want it all off.

720
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:43,167
I don't want a hairy T-shirt.

721
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:15,292
Looks like crap, right?

722
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,709
It looks good.

723
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:35,083
Have you ever done it?

724
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:38,709
-What? -You heard me.

725
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:39,834
No.

726
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,542
And?

727
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:47,584
And what?

728
01:04:50,001 --> 01:04:51,250
Want to?

729
01:04:52,626 --> 01:04:53,876
Want to what?

730
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:02,000
But I liked...

731
01:05:04,876 --> 01:05:06,834
your hand on my knee.

732
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:11,584
Ehhh...

733
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,334
Yes...

734
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,417
Why?

735
01:05:27,959 --> 01:05:29,292
You're shivering.

736
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:31,417
I know.

737
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,250
You don't know much.

738
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:36,959
I know.

739
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,834
We could just make out.

740
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:45,250
If you want.

741
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,792
Do you like sausages?

742
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,876
What are we doing here?

743
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:40,501
Taking a vacation. Just like normal people do.

744
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,626
It's just like "Game of Thrones."

745
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,751
The handrails ruin it.

746
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:08,209
(C.K.H. 23th April 1961
J. Wilke 1928)

747
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,501
Here's the oldest one.

748
01:07:12,501 --> 01:07:16,083
Anselm Wail, 1906.

749
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:17,876
All dead.

750
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:20,501
Like us in a hundred years.

751
01:07:54,042 --> 01:07:58,083
-At, mk, is... i like it. -I like it too.

752
01:07:58,584 --> 01:08:02,459
Someone just needs to scratch in some letters,

753
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:04,959
then it'll be "Atomic Crisis of 2016."

754
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:10,626
Let's cut our fingers,
and smear our blood on it.

755
01:08:11,292 --> 01:08:13,125
Are you Geronimo now?

756
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,083
No, dude, I'm a Jewish Gypsy.

757
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:30,792
(PRAGUE EXPRESS)

758
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:41,792
-What's she up to? -I don't know.

759
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,459
Do you have 30 euros?

760
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:47,292
I'll send it to you, I swear!

761
01:08:48,001 --> 01:08:49,792
My half-sister has money.

762
01:09:11,584 --> 01:09:13,125
I'll never make it with you guys.

763
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:42,083
You didn't fall in love again, did you?

764
01:09:44,626 --> 01:09:45,876
Seriously, though,

765
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:49,083
you have a way with women.

766
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:51,542
Or what's the phrase?

767
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:04,250
It was all too quick.

768
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,918
And we're singing in the fallout shelter,

769
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:09,751
Hurrah, this world goes helter skelter!

770
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,959
Hurrah, this world goes helter skelter!

771
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,167
Am I seeing things?

772
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:18,751
They're real!

773
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:20,584
Tschick!

774
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:18,334
I'm not sure about this.

775
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:20,334
I'm not driving back.

776
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:39,876
Here we go, here we go!

777
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,250
Tschick! Look out!

778
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:22,417
Are you hurt?

779
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,292
What happened?

780
01:12:58,459 --> 01:13:00,250
I can't drive like this.

781
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,334
That's it then, we're done.

782
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:08,918
-No way. you drive. -Have you lost your mind?

783
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:12,042
You just hit the gas and steer. I'll shift.

784
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:14,209
-No, man. -Why not?

785
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:16,167
I'm a coward.

786
01:13:17,584 --> 01:13:19,250
I'm a coward and I'm boring.

787
01:13:21,626 --> 01:13:24,042
I haven't been bored with you.

788
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:27,876
Not you, but Tatjana didn't even
invite me to her stupid party.

789
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:29,834
You know what?

790
01:13:29,834 --> 01:13:32,459
Compared to Isa, Tatjana is brain dead.

791
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:36,959
I can tell,

792
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:40,959
because...

793
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,375
I don't like girls.

794
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:54,375
I never told anybody that before.

795
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,167
Think of me what you please,
but I wasn't particularly surprised.

796
01:14:01,751 --> 01:14:05,125
For a moment I even thought about
becoming gay myself.

797
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:06,584
Give me my shoe.

798
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:11,792
That would have solved all my problems.
But I couldn't.

799
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:13,542
I just liked girls too much.

800
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,417
Just step on the clutch, left pedal.

801
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:33,334
Careful, let it up slowly.

802
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:34,417
Coupling

803
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:37,584
Super, actually.

804
01:14:37,584 --> 01:14:39,334
Let's try again.

805
01:14:42,959 --> 01:14:44,626
Careful, careful.

806
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,250
Not too much gas.

807
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:48,334
Let the clutch up slowly.

808
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:52,167
A little gas, that's right.

809
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,042
That's right.

810
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:56,042
Go, give it some gas.

811
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:58,001
Yeah, nice.

812
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:12,792
So...

813
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:17,709
Yes!

814
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:19,751
Nicely done, you coward!

815
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:43,375
La laa, la la laa la la laa laa...

816
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,292
What a shitty life.

817
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:02,125
What a fucking idiot!

818
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:03,375
Pass him!

819
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,000
Pass on the right!

820
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,709
Is he nuts?

821
01:16:25,626 --> 01:16:28,042
Should I try the emergency lane?

822
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,125
-If you think you can. -Yeah, just like "GTA."

823
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:24,417
So much for that.

824
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,709
You pigs!

825
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:28,209
I'm going to get you!

826
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:31,626
When I get my hands on you...

827
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,001
Are you okay?

828
01:17:34,834 --> 01:17:38,751
Help! Help!

829
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah.

830
01:17:40,459 --> 01:17:41,709
And you?

831
01:17:44,542 --> 01:17:46,542
I think I cut myself.

832
01:17:49,918 --> 01:17:53,834
Help!

833
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:57,125
Help!

834
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,375
Maik.

835
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,584
I have to go.

836
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:03,250
Or they'll put me in an orphanage.

837
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:12,334
Tschick!

838
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:32,542
Take it. It'll get cold.

839
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,000
See you later.

840
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,459
Kick-ass jacket.

841
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,959
Klingenberg, Maik.

842
01:19:16,626 --> 01:19:18,250
Maik with AI.

843
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:22,751
-Date of birth? -14 May 2002.

844
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:26,083
I'm only 14.

845
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:28,459
I'm quite able to count.

846
01:19:28,918 --> 01:19:31,834
-I'm not criminally accountable yet.
-Oh, yes you are.

847
01:19:32,292 --> 01:19:34,375
At 14 you are.

848
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,584
I thought it was 15.

849
01:19:36,626 --> 01:19:38,459
Nope, it's 14.

850
01:19:38,959 --> 01:19:40,292
15 is just baloney.

851
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:42,167
-Good morning. -Morning.

852
01:19:44,584 --> 01:19:46,000
Where do you live?

853
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:50,001
Maik?

854
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:52,876
Say something!

855
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:55,250
What? I said, yes!

856
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,459
Yes, I got it!

857
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,709
-You don't get a thing, you idiot!
-I'm not an idiot.

858
01:19:59,709 --> 01:20:01,167
I know we screwed up.

859
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,167
No, your Russian buddy screwed up

860
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:07,709
That antisocial asshole, he screwed up!

861
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:10,501
You're too dumb to adjust a rearview mirror.

862
01:20:10,626 --> 01:20:11,751
Josef.

863
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:16,876
Now listen to me.

864
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,792
You keep your mouth shut at the hearing.

865
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:23,125
The lawyer will tell the judge
exactly what happened.

866
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:26,001
Andrej Tschichatschow, "Tschick,"

867
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:27,876
fled and is therefore guilty.

868
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:31,292
Stealing the car was his idea.

869
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:35,042
He was also at the wheel
when the accident occurred.

870
01:20:35,626 --> 01:20:39,751
My client went along
because he was afraid of Andrej.

871
01:20:46,959 --> 01:20:48,334
That's not true.

872
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:50,334
Maik, sit down.

873
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:54,876
We both decided to drive off with the Lada.

874
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:58,250
And I was driving on the autobahn.

875
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,876
Stop this crap!

876
01:20:59,876 --> 01:21:01,667
Order, Herr Klingenberg,

877
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:03,876
I'll ask if I want to hear from you.

878
01:21:04,751 --> 01:21:06,667
Sit down, please.

879
01:21:10,042 --> 01:21:13,918
Maik. Is that the truth?

880
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:21,000
Yes, Your Honor.

881
01:21:33,876 --> 01:21:36,918
At school they tell us
violence is never the answer.

882
01:21:36,918 --> 01:21:38,501
Bullshit.

883
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:41,334
Josef!

884
01:21:44,876 --> 01:21:47,209
When you get sucker punched like that

885
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:50,001
you know damn well it's an answer.

886
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:53,001
Holy bejoly.

887
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:26,125
I thought about how things would be.

888
01:22:26,834 --> 01:22:29,501
How long we'd live in this house,

889
01:22:29,501 --> 01:22:32,125
how long my parents would stay married,

890
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,918
if my father would have kids with Mona...

891
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,584
What are you doing, mom?

892
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:01,250
Look at all this shit!

893
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:12,709
Give me a hand.

894
01:23:43,834 --> 01:23:46,834
I know exactly what I thought
as I held my breath under water.

895
01:23:47,834 --> 01:23:51,125
I thought there were a lot worse things
than having an alcoholic mother.

896
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:53,709
Or that father's gone.

897
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,292
Because you can't hold your breath forever,

898
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:58,834
but for a pretty long time.

899
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,959
And that was the summer. School started again.

900
01:24:20,876 --> 01:24:22,417
Can we talk?

901
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:26,000
I have to get to school.
It's the first day back.

902
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,417
We'll take you.

903
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,792
Do you know Andrej Tschichatschow?

904
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:32,501
He's my friend.

905
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:33,834
Where is he?

906
01:24:33,834 --> 01:24:34,959
No idea.

907
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:39,209
What happened?

908
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:41,083
A Lada was stolen.

909
01:24:42,459 --> 01:24:45,000
The day before yesterday, hot-wired.

910
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,250
Found it last night, totaled.

911
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:50,125
I got nothing to do with that, officer.

912
01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:53,876
I'm doing civil service
with the retards all day.

913
01:24:53,876 --> 01:24:55,792
Evenings I'm with my mom.

914
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,584
That bowled me over.

915
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:01,959
Tschick could have written a letter.

916
01:25:01,959 --> 01:25:04,417
But to total a Lada just to drop me a line,

917
01:25:04,417 --> 01:25:06,250
what an idea!

918
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,000
Is that Maik Klingenberg?

919
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,209
What happened to him?

920
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,250
Hey.

921
01:25:56,209 --> 01:25:58,709
...
as well as the Pythagorean Theorem.

922
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:02,876
Geometry and geometric forms,

923
01:26:02,876 --> 01:26:04,125
volumes,

924
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,876
surfaces, bodies, angles...

925
01:26:07,584 --> 01:26:10,001
symmetries...

926
01:26:10,001 --> 01:26:12,334
Hey, it's for you.

927
01:26:15,501 --> 01:26:17,334
(Maik)

928
01:26:17,334 --> 01:26:20,542
(Where were you this summer? - Tatjana.)

929
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:22,792
She had seen me.

930
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:26,001
Tatjana Cosic had finally seen me.

931
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:30,584
Before this summer I'd have jumped for joy.

932
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:34,501
But strangely, now I didn't care.

933
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:35,834
(In the boondocks.)

934
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:49,167
The only thing I cared about
s seeing Tschick again.

935
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:53,751
I thought without Tschick
I never would have had the summer we did,

936
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:56,000
and that it was a cool summer.

937
01:26:56,584 --> 01:26:58,417
The best summer ever.

938
01:26:58,417 --> 01:27:02,542
-At, mk, is... i like it. -I like it too.

939
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:06,375
Someone just needs to scratch in some letters,

940
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,417
then it'll be "Atomic Crisis of 2016."

941
01:27:08,417 --> 01:27:11,250
I was so excited to see Tschick again soon.

942
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,001
Tschick and Isa.

943
01:27:13,001 --> 01:27:16,001
If not next week, maybe a little later.

944
01:27:16,001 --> 01:27:17,959
'Cause, I almost forgot this part:

945
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:20,918
Let's meet up in 50 years at this exact spot.

946
01:27:21,709 --> 01:27:24,876
On 28 July 2066.

947
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,000
Whatever we're doing then.

948
01:27:30,167 --> 01:27:31,792
Or is that stupid?

949
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,167
No.

950
01:27:38,167 --> 01:27:39,542
We'll be here.

951
01:29:25,292 --> 01:29:29,417
(Sense-less)
